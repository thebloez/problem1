# Problem #1

### Installation

I assume you already have JDK (1.8 or latest) and maven.
#### Building for source
For running an unit test:
```sh
$ mvn test
```
build an application
```sh
$ mvn clean package
```
running an application
```sh
$ cd /target
$ java -jar kitabisa-test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar "string param"
```
